# dotfiles

This project contains the dotfiles and custom shell scripts that I use on my workstations.

Why keep them at GitHub? Itâ€™s a way to share advanced shell tips with other developers, and more practically, a way to back up my configuration. I was tired of having a bunch of configurations across all my machines, especially when trying to keep all up to date. So I got fed up and threw them on GitHub. It's not perfect (yet!), but it's a great starting point for any Linux config.

### Handy scripts

These scripts will be installed to `~/bin` and added to your `$PATH`:

* `fs-cryptmount.sh` Mounts a encFS filesystem where I keep personal data.
* `make_snapshot.sh` My personal backup solution to an external HD.
* `myip.sh` An script to obtain my real IP
* `DNS_Over_TLS.sh` Enable/disable DNS-Over-TLS. It's handy to allow the system to connect to baptive portal based networks.

### Shell enhancements (bash)

* Enable [Bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) framework. It includes autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions...
* Improved Bash history based on [this post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-bash-history-commands-and-expansions-on-a-linux-vps).
* Add useful aliases, like `ll`, `la`...
* `$EDITOR` is `vim`.
* `umask` is `077`.
* Configure private tokens from `$HOME/.env_private`.
* Set `$GOPATH`.

### Git configuration

* Enables color output and line-ending checks.
* Shortens common commands: `br`, `ci`, `co`, `df`, `lg`.

Remember to configure `user.name`, `user.email` and `user.signingkey` on `.gitconfig`.

### Vim Configuration
- 4 spaced tabs
- Autocompletion always on
- Case insensitive search
- Global highlighting of search matches
- Numbered lines
- Trailing whitespace highlighting
- Tons of plugins through [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim): `onedark`, `lightline`, `vim-ployglot`.
- [One Dark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) theme
