# dotfiles

This project contains the dotfiles and custom shell scripts that I use on my workstations.

Why keep them at GitHub? Itâ€™s a way to share advanced shell tips with other developers, and more practically, a way to back up my configuration. I was tired of having a bunch of configurations across all my machines, especially when trying to keep all up to date. So I got fed up and threw them on GitHub. It's not perfect (yet!), but it's a great starting point for any Linux config.

### Introduction
Each folder is named after a package and contains every configuration file used by that application. Besides some noted exceptions, the files inside the folders are relative to home (e.g. the file `vim/.vimrc` goes to `~/.vimrc`).

Every section here explains which settings and (if any) workarounds/fixes are used to obtain the described result.

For further reference, read carefully every section in this file, and copy only the configuration files relative to the parts you are trying to setup.

If none of these helped, feel free to open an issue here. Include your distro informations and the configuration values you are trying.
